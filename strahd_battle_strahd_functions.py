#move strahd action functions here once I figure out how to get around the undefined variables
#possibly will have to pare down these functions so they don't relate to variables in the main file?
#maybe databases will help?
#maybe passing in variables as parameters will help instead of trying to use global ones?

#list of problem items:
#strahd_bite, because it needs strahd_attack_mod and player_ac
#strahd_claws, because it needs strahd_attack_mod and player_ac
#strahd_attack_action, because it randomizes the two above functions

#move exposition functions here once I figure out how to get around the undefined variables
#possibly will have to pare down these functions so they don't relate to variables in the main file?
#maybe databases will help?
#maybe passing in variables as parameters will help instead of trying to use global ones?

#list of problem items:
#strahd_status, because it needs strahd_max_hp and strahd_hp
#strahd_wins_claw because it needs player_name and player_class
#strahd_wins_bite because it needs player_name and player_class
#ending_sequence because it needs player_hp and strahd_last_move
